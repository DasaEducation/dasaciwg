The DASA (Direct Admission of Students Abroad) scheme is an initiative by the Ministry of Education, Government of India. It facilitates the admission of foreign nationals, Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs), Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs), and Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) into undergraduate engineering programs in premier Indian institutions.
Under the DASA scheme, eligible candidates can secure admission to NITs (National Institutes of Technology), IIITs (Indian Institutes of Information Technology), SPAs (Schools of Planning and Architecture), and other premier centrally funded technical institutions in India. These admissions are based on the candidate's performance in qualifying exam JEE Main.
